Foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof.\ Gudrun Klinker, at \getUniversity{}, for giving me the opportunity to write my bachelor's thesis at her chair, Forschungsgruppe Augmented Reality.

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Sandro Weber for the close supervision and helpful advice.

A special thank goes to all my friends who took the time to participate in the evaluation.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for their continuous support during my studies and the writing of this thesis.
