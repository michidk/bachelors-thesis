Foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor, Prof.\ Gudrun Klinker,for giving me the opportunity to write my bachelor's thesis at her research group Forschungsgruppe Augmented Reality (FAR) at the Chair for Computer Aided Medical Procedures \& Augmented Reality.

I would also like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Sandro Weber for the close supervision and helpful advice.

A special thank goes to all my friends who took the time to participate in the evaluation.

Last but not least, I would like to thank my family for their continuous support during my studies and the writing of this thesis.
