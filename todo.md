# TO DO

- add info to thesis:
  - explaion that a wireless network can be used (experiment setup?)
  - evaluation form:
    - likert scales were used
    - SUS were used
    - inspired by Clemens Kamm

- create experiments
  - model inspector
    - match position of template model
    - //put different numbers (text) on skeleton, track time (manually finish)
  - laser pointer
    - spawn cubes (in seeing range of user), one after another, track avg time till hit;
  - keyboard
    - give random word to enter (same length and all lower case)
    - track how long it takes


# Notes

- check if other papers to similar experiments which compare
  make similar tasks
- check other papers for implementation methods

- laser pointer
  - unsere implementation rechtfertigen (imp):
    Smartcasting. But we dont use a depth controller, to control the current selection depth along the laser (3D cursor), because we want to limit us to visible objects (non occluding). It still would be posssible, though thanks to VR because the user is allowed to move in three dimensons.
  - unsere implementation/experiment/evaluation vergleichen (comp):
    Smartcasting Figure 6.
- model viewer
