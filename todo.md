# TO DO

- add info to thesis:
  - explaion that a wireless network can be used (experiment setup?)
  - evaluation form:
    - likert scales were used
    - SUS were used
    - inspired by Clemens Kamm

- write about experiments
  - laser pointer
    - unsere implementation rechtfertigen (imp):
      Smartcasting. But we dont use a depth controller, to control the current selection depth along the laser (3D cursor), because we want to limit us to visible objects (non occluding). It still would be posssible, though thanks to VR because the user is allowed to move in three dimensons.
    - unsere implementation/experiment/evaluation vergleichen (comp):
      Smartcasting Figure 6.
  - model viewer
    - imp:
      Mobile devices as multi-dof controllers part 5 Evaluation
    - comp:
      Mobile devices as multi-dof controllers part 5 Evaluation
  - virtual keyboard
    - imp: 
      - 10.1145/1866029.1866043
      - 10.1145/985921.986017
      - [ 10.1561/1100000012 ]
    - comp: wpm, but dont forget selection time
    - further improvements: one cursor per finger

- future work
  - sensor fusion
  - compare differenmt text input methods:
    - ours
    - LiftOff
    - SwiftKey
    - DriftBoard: https://dl-acm-org.eaccess.ub.tum.de/citation.cfm?id=2984591
