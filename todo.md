# TO DO

NOW:

- maybe:

  - explain VR https://wiki.tum.de/display/infar/MA+-+Exploration+and+Classification+of+State-of-the-art+3D+User+Interfaces+in+Virtual+and+Augmented+Reality+Scenarios?preview=%2F69049584%2F127468269%2Fmasterarbeit.pdf

  - describe experiment setup... which browser, which headsets and so on

* add info to thesis:

  - explaion that a wireless network can be used (experiment setup?)
  - evaluation form:
    - likert scales were used
    - SUS were used
    - inspired by Clemens Kamm

* write about experiments

  - laser pointer
    - unsere implementation rechtfertigen (imp):
      Smartcasting. But we dont use a depth controller, to control the current selection depth along the laser (3D cursor), because we want to limit us to visible objects (non occluding). It still would be posssible, though thanks to VR because the user is allowed to move in three dimensons.
    - unsere implementation/experiment/evaluation vergleichen (comp):
      Smartcasting Figure 6.
  - model viewer
    - imp:
      Mobile devices as multi-dof controllers part 5 Evaluation
    - comp:
      Mobile devices as multi-dof controllers part 5 Evaluation
  - virtual keyboard
    - imp:
      - 10.1145/1866029.1866043
      - 10.1145/985921.986017
      - [ 10.1561/1100000012 ]
    - comp: wpm, but dont forget selection time
    - further improvements: one cursor per finger

* future work

  - sensor fusion like in Steed.2013
  - compare differenmt text input methods:
    - ours
    - LiftOff
    - SwiftKey
    - DriftBoard: https://dl-acm-org.eaccess.ub.tum.de/citation.cfm?id=2984591

* correction

  - check for usage of times.. time should be consistent (is used vs. was used)
  - paste into grammarly and languagetool
    - done for abstract
    - done for introduction
    - done for implementation
  - check citations in .pdf for plausability and correctness and formatting
  - use \linewidth to scale figures
  - think about increasing the font width of labels in python plots
  - think about renaming references to section from Chapter~\ref to Section~\ref
