# TO DO

NOW:

- explain VR https://wiki.tum.de/display/infar/MA+-+Exploration+and+Classification+of+State-of-the-art+3D+User+Interfaces+in+Virtual+and+Augmented+Reality+Scenarios?preview=%2F69049584%2F127468269%2Fmasterarbeit.pdf

* correction

  - check for usage of times.. time should be consistent (is used vs. was used) ?
  - think about increasing the font width of labels in python plots
  - think about renaming references to section from Chapter~\ref to Section~\ref
  - maybe mention source of model fileszhan
  - read thorough fopmalities/requirements and check
