\section{Model Viewer}\label{section:eval-mv}

The model viewer experiment, presented in Section~\ref{subsection:model-viewer}, allows users to view \ac{3D} model from different angles. To benchmark extensive usage, a second model instance in another color (the target) is spawned after starting the task. Since in the current implementation, the model cannot be rotated upside down (as mentioned in), the target is spawned with random reachable orientations.
As soon as the task is started, the user has 30 seconds to match as many orientations as possible. After one orientation is matched, the target is rotated to a new random orientation.
Because it is hard to match the rotation exactly on all three axes, it is enough to pose the model similar to the target.
