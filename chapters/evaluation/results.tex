The main disciplines and degrees are shown in Table~\ref{tab:sus-d}. As seen in Table~\ref{tab:sus-degree}, the highest degree of half of the participants was a high school degree or equivalent. Table~\ref{tab:sus-discipline} shows that the main discipline is quite spread amongst different disciplines.

All participants (100.00\%) used their smartphone multiple times a day during the last six months. Most participants (78.26\%) used their computer for work or studies more than once per day during the last six months. 17.39\% state that they used it daily and only one participant used his computer one to three times a week for work or studies during the last six months. As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:res-demo-q8-s3}, most participants (60.87\%) played computer games more than three times a month during the last six months. Figure~\ref{fig:res-demo-q8-s4} shows that most participants (91.30\%) used \ac{VR} less than once per month during the last six months. A huge portion (39.13\%) did not use \ac{VR} at all in the last six moths.

\end{figure}

The participants were asked three questions regarding their experience with \ac{VR} which could be answered with values ranging from one (\enquote{none}) to five (\enquote{a lot}). The first questions asked about the knowledge the user had about \ac{VR}. As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:res-demo-q9}, the general knowledge about \ac{VR} seems to be rather low (Mean: 2.83; Standard Deviation: 1.03). The second question asked about the interest in \ac{VR}, to which not one participant answered with the value one (Mean: 3.48; Standard Deviation: 0.99). The last question asked about the experience with motion controllers. It was explicitly mentioned that the Wii remote counts as motion controller, which might be the reason for the average, which is higher than the one from the first question (Mean: 3.30; Standard Deviation: 1.22).

\subsection{Model Viewer}\label{section:eval-res-mv}

The model viewer experiment, described in Section~\ref{subsection:model-viewer}, allows users to view a \ac{3D} model from different angles. To benchmark extensive usage, a second model instance in another color (the target) is spawned after starting the task. Since in the current implementation, the model cannot be rotated upside down (as mentioned in Section~\ref{subsection:topic-data}), the target is spawned with random reachable orientations.
As soon as the task is started, the user has 30 seconds to match as many orientations as possible. Similar to the implementation by \citeauthor{Katzakis.2010}, the target is rotated to a new random orientation, after one orientation was matched~\cite[140]{Katzakis.2010}.
Because it is hard to match the rotation exactly on all three axes, it is enough to pose the model in a similar orientation to the target. A similar pose is reached, when the smallest angle between the two rotations is less than 20 radians.

% TODO: T-Test:

% chktex 1
As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:eval-exp-mv}, the average time it took to match a correct poses is roughly \evalExpMvAvgPoses{} seconds. \citeauthor{Katzakis.2010} tracked the time it takes to match a pre-defined pose with a Smartphone, a mouse and a touch panel. The lowest time in average to match one pose, 6.5 seconds, was achieved using the Smartphone as input device~\cite[140]{Katzakis.2010}. The average time to match a pose of the model viewer (\evalExpMvAvgPoses{} seconds) experiment presented in Chapter~\ref{section:eval-res-mv} is lower than the average of the evaluation of \citeauthor{Katzakis.2010} (6.5 seconds). This can be due to the fact that users never had to turn the smartphone completely upside down, since rotations were chosen to be always upside up, because of the previously mentioned limitation. Another advantage of the presented implementation is, that the target and the controlled model are not displayed in two separate locations like in {\citetitle{Katzakis.2010}}, but rather with the same origin in the same coordinate space, which makes it easier to see the difference between both rotations~\cite[140]{Katzakis.2010}. Also the fact that a skeleton model instead of a multi-colored cube was used, could play a role.

\subsection{Laser Pointer}\label{section:eval-res-lp}

Section~\ref{subsection:laser-pointer} introduces the laser pointer experiment. To test the performance of participants using this interaction, three cubes (the targets) are spawned at random locations in front of the user. He has to select as much cubes as possible in 30 seconds. The user was told to be as fast and especially as accurate as possible, since miss-hits are counted. 

To trigger a selection, the user has to touch the smartphone display. This counts as a click. If no cube was selected, a miss is counted. The total selection (click) count is the sum of hits and miss-clicks. If one cube was hit, another one is spawned, so that always three cubes are visible. This is important, because the user can plan to hit the next target while currently aiming for the current one. Otherwise the task would test the users reaction time, which is not desired.

The performance of this experiment is hard to compare with other implementations, without a standardized experiment setup. For example the size, shape, position and distance of the targets but also the spawn area and wether distracting elements are present or not, varies between different task evaluations of other research. However a comparison should still give a rough estimate wether the performance is similar, much better or really bad. Often the hit count is measured in different time intervals. To compare the results, the average hit count per second is calculated.

\citeauthor{Kamm.2018} tested his implementation in a similar \ac{VR} scenario with a wrist band as input device. To compare his implementation, he also tested a laser pointer approach using a \ac{VR} motion controller~\cite[39]{Kamm.2018}. A major difference to his experiment setup is, that only one target is displayed at a time. Another difference is, that the user has to rotate his head more in order to see the targets, since they are placed in a 90 degrees radius. An arrow, which always points to the next target, is displayed to prevent wasting time while searching for the next one. Also the distance from the user to the targets is randomized~\cite[45]{Kamm.2018}.

\citeauthor{Pietroszek.2014} compared a smartphone and a Wii Remote as interaction device for a large display. The task was to move the pointer from one point to another~\cite[124]{Pietroszek.2014}. To compare it with the presented experiments, the results of the one without distraction elements using the smartphone is used.
